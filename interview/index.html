		<h1> An Interview with Kelly Ann Deline </h1>
		
		<p><span class="question">First question; you're planning on designing your own website, correct? What is it for? </span></p>
		
		<p><span class="answer">It's for a travel blog.</span></p>

		<p><span class="question">Have you come up with any ideas on how you want it laid out and are there any specific websites that have inspired your ideas for it?</span></p>

		<p><span class="answer">Yes. There's a website called 'My Perfect Itinerary', and one called 'The Bucket List Family' and both of those, um, kind of inspired my preferred layout.</span></p>

		<p><span class="question">Okay, what do you think is your favourite part of the website, or will be?</span></p>

		<p><span class="answer">Probably the destinations page.</span></p>
		
		<p><span class="question">Why is that?</span></p>

		<p><span class="answer">Because it will be a log where I can go back and look and see all the different places that I've been, and places  that I've stayed; with pictures and also information.</span></p>

		<p><span class="question">Cool! Have you ever done a project like this before?</span></p>

		<p><span class="answer">Sort of? In college I had to do an online portfolio, [where] I used Wix, which is just like a... website building service I guess? But it was like just for a mark, it wasn't... similar to the travel blog idea.</span></p>

		<p><span class="question">What inspired you or drove you to begin something like this?</span></p>

		<p><span class="answer">I travel quite a bit and I figured my knowledge was, um... my experience and knowledge was something that I should share with the world. That's pretty much it.</span></p>

		<p><span class="question">Do you plan on expanding outside of the website in any way? As in like books or Youtube or anything?</span></p>

		<p><span class="answer">I would love to expand into Youtube. Obviously instagram, facebook, twitter, um, different social media. And then if it ever took off really big, maybe into merchandise?</span></p>

		<p><span class="question">Ending off, what advice can you offer to someone who wants to do the same thing and isn't really sure where to start?</span></p>

		<p><span class="answer">I would say start by looking at websites that are similar to the one you want to make, like similar topics, and just kind of get inspiration from there.</span></p>

		<p><span class="question">Thanks!</span></p>

  <h1><span class="titles">Hello all!</span></h1>

  <p>My name is Agnes, but I like to go by <span class="emphasize">Aggie.</span> I haven't done much web coding before so this is all pretty new to me, so here's to hoping it goes well on here.</p>

  <p><span class="notes">A little about me as a fellow human: I have two cats, I love to draw (don't we all here though?? haha) I love reading, and I also like to play around with different designs in different ways just to keep my practice up, cause goodness knows I could use it. 
  I'm kinda shy in person, but I'm always super excited about stuff so hopefully that shows up in my work! :) See ya (sort of??)</span></p>

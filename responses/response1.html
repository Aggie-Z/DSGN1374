			<h1>A Shifting House Next to a River of Knowledge</h1>

			<p>You know why stuff seems scary in most cases? Because our brain is tricking us into thinking it's way worse than it actually is. Power of the mind, am I right?</p>

			<p> That's how web design has always been for me. I hear anything about code, and I immediately wanna run for the hills... But a different perspective made me want to try it out with a different approach! What if instead of this giant wall of text, it was just a base little house that I could repaint and decorate however I wanted, add in some shelves and maybe some plants that grow over time into something amazing, and it becomes this awesome thing I made all on my own! I could make it so personal! And to be fair that really does sound like a "well, duh..." kind of moment, but somehow it never connected in my mind how creative I could be even on the web right from the get go. </p>

			<p>I'm an artist, afterall. A creative thinker. So why am I not thinking outside the box when it comes to web designs and layouts? Heck, that's what I might be hired for one day, right? So... let's get creative! Slap some colour here, throw some hyperlinks there, honestly f*ck it! I'll never learn if I don't try and fail and just try again. So... here's me telling myself to just go with it and see what creative stuff I can do instead of limiting myself over here. </p>
